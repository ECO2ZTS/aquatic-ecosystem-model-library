# Welcome to the aquatic-ecosystem-model-library
## Introduction
This is a repository created by the  AEMON-J network for developing/documenting the existing aquatic ecosystem models. We aim at making
1. a wiki page that can help you surfing around different model features (the wiki tab);
2. a repository that contains more detailed model data (code);
3. a final documentation of aquatic ecosystem model conclusion. 

Our intention is to create an interactive platform to help new modellers to choose the models that suit their needs, and to attract more advanced modeller to input their modelling knowledge. 
If you want to contribute to the project, please contact AEMON-J, and we will give you permission to edit the repository.
## I am a new modeller
1. Go to wiki page and surf the modelling information.
2. More detailed model entry form is in the code repository, /model-entry-forms/..
3. Can not find information your need? Just ask a question/raise an issue under issues. The community including the team behind this project will help you.

## I want to be a contributor
1. Contribute to an new model: download the empty model entry form under code/model-entry-forms/Model Library - Entry form.pdf and fill in your model information. Afterwards, upload the completed file directly to our repository through upload files. (your upload request will be pending for the project team members to approve, but we will contact you as soon as possible)
2. Contribute to the wiki page: if you have anything wanted to add to our wiki page, you can directely edit the page. 

## The AEMON-J model library team
The AEMON-J model library team is run within AEMON-J organization. We are 5 young researchers who voluntarily work on this project. We wanted to created a community based model information platform, so aquatic ecosystem models can be more accessible to the broader community.
