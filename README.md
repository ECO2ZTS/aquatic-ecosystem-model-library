# aquatic-ecosystem-model-library
## Introduction
This is a repositroy owned by AMEON-J network for developing/documenting the existed aquatic ecosystem models. We aim at making a wiki page that can help you surfing around different model features(under wiki), a repository that contains more detailed model data(code), and an final documentation of aquatic ecosystem model conclusion. 
Our intention is to created an interactive platform to help new modellers to choose the models that suit their needs, and to attract more advanced modeller to input their modelling knowledge. 
If you want to contribute to the project, please contact AEMON-J, and we will give you permission to edit the repository.
