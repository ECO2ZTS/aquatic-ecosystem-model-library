# Welcome to aquatic-ecosystem-model-library
## Introduction
This is a repositroy owned by AMEON-J network for developing/documenting the existed aquatic ecosystem models. We aim at making
1. a wiki page that can help you surfing around different model features(under wiki);
2. a repository that contains more detailed model data(code);
3. a final documentation of aquatic ecosystem model conclusion. 

Our intention is to created an interactive platform to help new modellers to choose the models that suit their needs, and to attract more advanced modeller to input their modelling knowledge. 
If you want to contribute to the project, please contact AEMON-J, and we will give you permission to edit the repository.
## I am a new modeller?
1. Go to wiki page and surf the modelling inforamtion.
2. More detailed model entry form is in the code repository, /model-entry-forms/..
3. can not find information your need? aske a question/raise an issue under issues. The community(inclduing the team behind this project will help you)

## I want to be a contributor?
1. Contribute to an new model: download the emppty model entry form under code/model-entry-forms/model-entry-form-empty.docx and fill your model information. Afterwards, upload the completed file directely to our repository through upload files. (your upload request will be pending for the project team members to approve, but we will contact you as soon as possible)
2. contribute to the wiki page: if you have anything wanted to add to our wiki page, you can directely edit the page. 
## The AMEON-J model library team
The AMEON-J model library team is run within AMEON-J organization. We are 5 young researchers volenteerly work on this project. We wanted to created a community based model information platform, so we aquatic ecosystem models can be more accessible to the broader community.
